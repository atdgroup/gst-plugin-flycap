flycapsrc
=========

What it is
----------

This is a source element for GStreamer 1.0 for live acquisition from a camera that uses the 
flycapature SDK from Point Grey (https://www.ptgrey.com/support/downloads).

Comments
--------

 - Contains the ability to setup the 2 LUTs with gamma curves for different dynamic ranges. The default is
 for LUT1 to have a normalish respoense, but LUT2 to have a more sensitive response, both have 0.45 gamma.

 - Contains specific binned image sizes for the 1288x964 and 808x608 sensors. If you camera has a different
 number of pixels this will have to be changed.
 
 - Contains code to expand the binned image to fill the full frame, so avoiding pipeline renegotiation issues 
 when the binning changes. So far this is done by duplicating data to neighboring pixels. There is skeleton code 
 to do this by interpolation instead, but this does not work so far.
 
 - Contains a maxframerate property, that will limit the frame rate pushed to the pipeline. The frame rate can get smaller 
 if the exposure time is long, but if the exposure time is short the frame rate may be limited at the given value.
 
 - Contains the ability to read 2 specific camera registers: the ROI used for white balance and auto gain, and the white balance register.
 Extension to read other registers should be simple.


Building
--------

Building on linux is tested using the autogen script.
Tested with flycapture2-2.8.3.1-amd64 on Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit.

First run autogen.sh
	$ chmod a+x autogen.sh
	$ ./autogen.sh
This will use autotools to setup the dev environment, and complete with the line:
"Now type 'make' to compile this module."
You can do that.
	$ make

	$ sudo make install 
will put install the lo file for use with GStreamer, in /usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0
To use this in a pipeline you need to tell gstreamer where to find the .lo file.
use:
	$ export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0

See the INSTALL file for advanced setup.

To import into the Eclipse IDE, use "existing code as Makefile project", and the file EclipseSymbolsAndIncludePaths.xml is included here
to import the library locations into the project (Properties -> C/C++ General -> Paths and symbols).

Libraries
---------

Download and install the flycap SDK from Point Grey (https://www.ptgrey.com/support/downloads).

The file src/Makefile.am contains pointers to where with flycap includes and libraries are expected to be.
